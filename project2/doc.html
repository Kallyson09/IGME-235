    <p>Goal of site: Want to create an informational describing a personal game and include some documentation of the
        creation process. My audience will be anyone interested in my game or the game's creation. I chose this layout
        to follow because I liked the balance between text and images. It had a lot of text so I had more space to talk
        about the different aspects of my game, while also weaving in some images so the reader isn't overloaded with
        text.
