        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>
            <em>Dig Dug</em> is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to dig your way through
            the earth. 
            <br>Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called Pooka and Fygar, who will continually chase
            you around.
            <br>The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the
            point where they explode. [...]

            This definitely goes under the heading of "Games That Were Made While a Programmer Was on Drugs," or at
            least had a good imagination. 
            <br>And maybe they were into horror movies too.
