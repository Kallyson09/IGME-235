            <h3>Story Introduction</h3>
            <p class="first">The number of missing children on Halloween has increased exponentially in the past decade,
                with no explanation or evidence as to how they have gone missing. A local legend has spread among the
                young residents of the town that if you enter the local graveyard at midnight, there is rumored to be a
                mask that appears by the old gazebo that lies at the edge of the graveyard and the forest. Once you see
                it, it's already too late. The police lock up the graveyard each year to prevent kids and teens from
                entering, but they say there is nothing more that they can do since it's just a silly made-up legend… or
                so they thought.</p>
            <img src="media/missing-poster.png" alt="Missing poster" class="blockImg">
            <p>It's been two years since Ophelia's little sister went missing. Her family urged the police to keep
                investigating, but the police had categorized her case as another one of the many missing children on
                Halloween. Since then, Ophelia's household had never been as quiet as it is now, as if all colors had
                been drained from their lives. Halloween, what once used to be a favorite family tradition, had died
                out. On the day of Halloween, Ophelia gets an invitation from a friend to a party happening late at
                night in the neighborhood, just past the graveyard. </p>
            <p>Ophelia wakes up in a strange room to an unfamiliar voice. In the reflection of a rustic mirror, a woman
                in a gold-detailed gown and mask calls to Ophelia. She explains to her that on All Hallows' Eve, a
                portal opens connecting her world and this twisted dimension full of monsters. These monsters have been
                using the portal to harvest children for this grand masquerade ball feast, increasing their lifespan and
                allowing them to continue living this lavish life. Although it usually calls out to young children, it's
                strange this time that it called to Ophelia, which could mean there's a chance her sister is alive. </p>
            <p>To
                open the portal from inside this dimension, Ophelia will need to collect four golden items, which may be
                scattered around the castle. Before Ophelia leaves, she warns her that it's extremely risky, and the
                portal will close for a whole year if she doesn't make it back in 24 hours. Determined, Ophelia needs to
                find answers, and by leaving now, she would regret it for the rest of her life. So, on a final note, she
                lends Ophelia her mask so that the other monsters won't recognize her, but warns Ophelia to avoid the
                ones in black masks at all costs.</p>

            <h3>Project Work</h3>
            <p class="first">For this game jam, I think I started strong with the planning/brainstorming process. I had
                a nice Google Doc that I used to brainstorm my ideas for the theme and mechanics. I created a Trello
                board to keep track of my progress, but looking back, I definitely should have used it more than I did.
                A lot of stuff that I had planned out kind of became unorganized towards the end because I didn't really
                follow my schedule and had to cram everything in close to the submission time. It was a bit difficult
                for me to stick to a schedule and focus on the game jam because I was trying to balance working on
                actual work for my classes, and I just kept pushing it aside. It also took me a long time to actually
                start creating the mechanics of the game, so that itself took a bit of time to figure out. Another thing
                I didn't realize was how time consuming creating my own assets would be and I think in the future, I
                would spend more time getting the whole experience and mechanics down first, rather than making the art.
                It was kind of a sacrifice I made, but I guess it's not too terrible since some comments on my
                submission said they liked my art style. Overall, I would say my experience was a little rocky towards
                the end, but it was a good learning experience for future game jams. Although I wasn't able to make the
                game long, I think I've set a really good starting place for this project.</p>
