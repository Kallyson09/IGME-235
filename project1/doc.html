    Goal of site: Want to create an informational describing a personal game and include some documentation of the creation process. My audience will be anyone interested in my game or the game's creation. I chose this layout to follow because I liked the balance between text and images. It had a lot of text so I had more space to talk about the different aspects of my game, while also weaving in some images so the reader isn't overloaded with text.

COMMENTS
    I already added some responsive design into the site, overlooked the part in the project description where we only had to make a sketch of it.
