    <h1>DOCUMENTATION</h1>

    <p>Original Design Source provided in instructions.</p>

    <p>Link to spec: <a href = "https://people.rit.edu/alk7915/235/project1/spec.html">https://people.rit.edu/alk7915/235/project1/spec.html</a></p>

    <p>Goal of site: Want to create an informational describing a personal game and include some documentation of the
        creation process. My audience will be anyone interested in my game or the game's creation. I chose this layout
        to follow because I liked the balance between text and images. It had a lot of text so I had more space to talk
        about the different aspects of my game, while also weaving in some images so the reader isn't overloaded with
        text.

    <h2>COMMENTS</h2>
    <p>(Phase 1) I already added some responsive design into the site, overlooked the part in the project description where we
        only had to make a sketch of it.</p>
