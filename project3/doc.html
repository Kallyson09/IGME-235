        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>I started this proposal design with assistance from AI, however it was not used in the development of this
            game and most of the game's concept I had already decided on beforehand. By making modifications and
            receiving helpful feedback from peers, I was able to find many ways to make it unique.</p>

        <p>For this project, I used a previous homework assignment to build off of since it was similar to what I wanted
            to create. For the mechanics, I was inspired by an arcade game inside another game Stardew Valley (isn't
            that crazy) called Journey of the Prairie King. It was a little difficult to figuring out how to use
            keyboard input with PIXI.js, but I found ways around it. As for the darkness effect, I made a custom sprite
            in Krita with a transparency mask. I made it double the size of the canvas so the edges wouldn't show and
            had it follow the player around. I also made sure to change the zIndex so that everything except UI would be
            hidden in the dark.</p>
